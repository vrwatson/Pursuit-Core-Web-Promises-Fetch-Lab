# Pursuit-Core-Web-Promises-Fetch-Lab

Use the [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) and Fetch to build the site described below:


# 1. Part one: MVP

Add the following to get your MVP in place

- A list of jokes that are randomly loaded when the page is refresehd
- Clicking on a joke card should expand it and reveal the punchline
- Clicking on it again should contract it and hide the punchline
- A button that refreshes clears all the jokes on the screen and loads new random ones

# 2. Part two: extra features

- Have a select at the top for either `general`, `random`, or `programming` and only load jokes of that type
- Keep track of all of the jokes the user has seen so far, and don't show them the same joke twice when they click a button for new jokes
